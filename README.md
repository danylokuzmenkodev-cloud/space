# Space Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Environment

- **Node.js:** 21.7.1
- **npm:** 10.5.0

Make sure you have these versions installed to avoid any compatibility issues.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and filenames include hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed.  

See [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Warning:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back.

Use this command only if you need full control over the build configuration.  
All configuration files and dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) will be copied into your project.

All other commands (`start`, `build`, `test`) will still work, but point to the copied scripts.
